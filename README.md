# GVC-Seg: Training Free 3D Instance Segmentation via  Geometric Visual Correspondence

[[project page](https://liangxu123.github.io/GVC/)] [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/)]

GVC-Seg(Geometric Visual Correspondence), a novel training-free 3D instance segmentation framework. By combining 3D geometric and 2D visual cues in a training-free manner, GVC-Seg prompts more reliable proposal generation and selection, which alleviates the confidence bias of multi-scale, multi-source proposals.
